pdftoogg
========

A short Python script that converts a pdf into an ogg file. I've only tested it on debian, but it seems to be working ok. It produces a few error that I need to look into and I could neaten up a few of the for loops and whatnot to make it a bit nice to read.

Ideas and bits of code shamelessly ripped from http://picospeaker.tk/ and https://github.com/redacted/XKCD-password-generator

Requires pdftotext (Should be on most linux systems) and pico2wave can be found by installing libttspico0, libttspico-data and libttspico-utils.

This is free and unencumbered software released into the public domain.
